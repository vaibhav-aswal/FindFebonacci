## 🔢 Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0, and 1. This repository showcases multiple ways to generate this series:

1. Using loops
2. With recursion
3. Utilizing memoization
4. And more...

## 🔄 Basic Java Programs

This section of the repository is tailored for beginners, aiming to introduce them to the fundamentals of loops in Java, such as:

1. For loop
2. While loop
3. Do-While loop

Each program is annotated with comments to help beginners grasp the logic and understand the underlying concepts.

## 🚀 Getting Started
